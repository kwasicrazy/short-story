	<h1>All about the young black coder from Ghana</h1>
	<p>My name is Tsatsu Seth Sedo, born and raised in Accra-Ghana.
	A high school graduate with a diploma in business administration, worked in hospitality for 4yrs and started two startup which didn't go well. I'm generally a problem solver with an eye for details.</p>
	<br>
	<h2>Welcome to my Story</h2>
	<p>My love for coding started way back after high school when I begin to identify societal problems coding can solve but there was a problem; which was, I was very good in all subject except Maths, We all hear coding is for Maths lovers so I thought of burrying my coding dreams for the fear of failure. Recently I Man up to face the challenge of becoming the coder I always wanted and I'm begining to love it. The journey has just started but I believe with passion, perseverance and proactiveness the sky is my limit.</p>
	<h3> WHY CODING?</h3>
	<p class="">Coding is vital to every technology under the sun. Cars run on it, computers won't work without it.
	Infact, coding has become essental that some schools have started teaching it in kindegaten and as student progress 
	in accademics. Real-world problem solving opportunities are increasingly centered on coding. Coding has over 700 languages , some programming languages such as Java, Python and Html are common others like Rust and Kotlin are used in very specific situation.</p>
	<br>
	<p>Coding might soon be important as reading in the near future. Coding and technical literacy may be nearly essential to daily life as literacy is now and the only way to learn is to practice.
	You don't have to work in tech to use coding and those who will learn to code early and well will surely have many career choices in different industries, also coding has definite cognitive benefits.</p>
	<p id="codencash">Oh! not forgetting there is big money coding, not a bed of roses but coding is a trillion dollar industry and you can position yourself to make as much as possible with the right skills and attitude.</p>
	<h4>I believe this age soft and hard skills are equally important, but those who understand teamwork, solving problem, detailed oriented and expeience mistakes as part of a learning proccess will RULE THE FUTURE! </h4>
